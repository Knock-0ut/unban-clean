# unban-clean
to use woofer read the following,
Requirements : 
- A USB Stick 

This Also Fresh Reinstalls Windows Which Helps You With HWID Bans

1) Backup Your Stuff To Google Drive or Discord or something so your not taking half a day to get everything back.

2) Download Rufus.
( Website: https://rufus.ie/en/ )
( Direct Download: https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.21/rufus-3.21.exe )

3) Open Rufus & Plug your usb in.

4) Download Any Windows Update You Want.
(Recommended In My Opinion: https://www.itechtics.com/?dl_id=140 (windows 10 21H1).

5) In Rufus Make Sure your usb is detected then under boot selection make sure Disk or ISO image (please select).

6) Click the select button and select the iso of the windows update you downloaded.

7) Then Select the Start Button on the bottom of the application for the iso to be install on the usb.

8) Once done restart your pc

9) While your pc is booting backup make sure your clicking your startup options for me its F11.

10) If you clicked it at the right time a bootup screen will appear and select the usb boot up

11) Now it will run through the windows install and after thats done you will now be on the desired Winver.

this allows better access to mods, (i dont use cleaners they mess with my pc but they will unban you)
